# 🥊 UFC Fight Data Analysis

## 📖 Introduction
This project analyzes 3 decades of UFC fight data to uncover trends in fighter attributes, performance metrics, and fight outcomes. An online dataset has been utilized with several added columns calculating differntials to facilitate analysis. All insights are summarized through Excel pivot tables and visualizations.

## 📂 Contents
### 1. Main Dataset
Full fight dataset with added calculated columns (height/reach/age differences, strike/takedown/submission differentials, win method classifications, etc.) to facilitate analysis.

### 2. Fights & Events Overview
Pivot tables and charts showing number of fights and events per year, fight volume by weight class.

### 3. Title vs. Non-Title Trends
Tables and charts for title fights by year, non-title fights by year, and both categories broken down by weight class.

### 4. Performance Metrics vs. Win Rate
Analysis of significant strike differential, takedown differential, and submission attempt differential and their correlation with win rates.

### 5. Attribute Advantages
Height, reach, and age differences compared against win rate.

### 6. Submission Analysis
Charts showing submission wins vs. submission attempts, along with the popularity of each submission type.

### 7. Win Method Patterns
Tables and charts analyzing win methods by count, win methods across weight classes, and yearly trends in win types.

## 🎯 Outcomes
This exploratory analysis serves as a foundation for data-driven MMA insights and future predictive modelling. Moreover it helps us answer questions such as:
- Do height, reach, or age advantages increase a fighter’s chance of winning?
- How does significant strikes, takedowns, and submission attempts correlate with victory?
- Which win methods (KO/TKO, submission, decision) dominate overall, and how have they changed over time?
- Which submission types are most common across UFC history?
- How do fight outcomes differ across weight classes?
